export const FLOOR_PLAN_PROMPT = `TASK: Convert the input 2D floor plan into a photorealistic, top-down 3D architectural render.

Return a structured JSON object describing every room, wall, door, window, and furniture item detected.

STRICT REQUIREMENTS (do not violate):
1) REMOVE ALL TEXT: Do not render letters, numbers, labels, dimensions, or annotations.
2) GEOMETRY MUST MATCH: Walls, rooms, doors, and windows must follow the exact lines and positions.
3) TOP-DOWN ONLY: Orthographic top-down view. No perspective tilt.
4) CLEAN, REALISTIC OUTPUT: Crisp edges, balanced lighting, realistic materials.
5) NO EXTRA CONTENT: Do not add rooms, furniture, or objects not clearly indicated by the plan.

STRUCTURE & DETAILS:
- Walls: Extrude precisely from plan lines. Consistent height (2.8m) and thickness (0.15m).
- Doors: Convert door swing arcs into open doors aligned to the plan.
- Windows: Convert thin perimeter lines into realistic glass windows.

FURNITURE MAPPING (only where icons/fixtures are clearly shown):
- Bed icon → bed (dimensions ~1.6 x 2.0m)
- Sofa icon → sofa (dimensions ~2.2 x 0.9m)
- Dining table icon → table (dimensions ~1.5 x 0.8m)
- Kitchen → counters with sink and stove
- Bathroom → toilet, sink, and tub/shower
- Office → desk (~1.4 x 0.7m) and chair
- Washer/dryer → washer (~0.6 x 0.6m)

TEXTURES & MATERIALS:
- Hardwood floors in living areas and bedrooms
- Tile in kitchens and bathrooms
- Carpet in defined lounge areas
- White or off-white painted walls (#F5F5F0)
- Matte ceiling finish

COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- All positions in meters from the building origin (0, 0, 0)
- x = horizontal axis (left to right)
- z = depth axis (front to back)
- y = height (0 = floor level)

OUTPUT FORMAT: Return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no backticks, no explanation outside JSON.
